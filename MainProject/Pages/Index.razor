    As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the Maserati Levante was not specifically known for being easy to break. It's important to note that "easy to break" can mean different things to different people, and it can be interpreted in various ways.

    The Maserati Levante is a luxury SUV, and like other vehicles in its class, it would generally be engineered to meet certain safety and quality standards. That being said, some owners may have concerns or complaints about specific aspects of any vehicle, including luxury brands like Maserati.

    One thing to keep in mind is that luxury vehicles often have more complex electronic systems, luxury amenities, and high-performance parts that may require specialized care and maintenance. If not properly maintained, these systems could experience issues. However, this would not generally translate to the vehicle being "easy to break."

    If you are considering purchasing a Maserati Levante or have specific concerns about its reliability or durability, it would be a good idea to check the latest consumer reviews, dependability ratings, and talk to specialists or mechanics familiar with the brand and model for the most up-to-date and relevant insights.
